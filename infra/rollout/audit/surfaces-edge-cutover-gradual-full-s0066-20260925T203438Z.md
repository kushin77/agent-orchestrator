# Promotion audit record - `surfaces.edge_cutover` gradual -> full

One transition, written by the promotion path immediately BEFORE the
live-state entry that names it (`infra/rollout/cli.py promote --live-state-out`,
and the ordered driver `infra/rollout/go_live.py`). `check_rollout.py` refuses a
promoted flag whose record is missing, so this file is what makes the promotion
provable rather than claimed.

| field | value |

| approval | human approval_id `ao-20260925T203034Z-surfaces-edge_cutover-full` |

| audit log | `audit/promotion-audit.jsonl` seq 66, hash `4a9b2e136e1f2f5111062f38ab53490cc36229b9d365e2793fe0357995b4fe6d` |

## The command (re-runnable)

```
python3 infra/rollout/go_live.py --phase 0-7 --canary-health-ok --gradual-complete --actor deployer-sa
```

## What the engine reported

```
promoted surfaces.edge_cutover gradual -> full
```

A record is evidence, not a claim: the audit-log line above is machine-checkable
(`AuditLog.verify` recomputes the sha-256 chain) and the transition it names is
the one the live-state entry carries.
